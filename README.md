# matrix
A program to manipulate matrices. For the moment is able to calculate the determinant of a single matrix from a file entered as

1 2 4 
1 3 7 
9 2 4 

For the future I'd like to be able to perform matrix multiplication of two matrices entered as

1 2 4\n
1 3 7\n
9 2 4 \n

0 2 4\n
1 5 7\n
0 2 4\n
